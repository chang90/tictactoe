## Demo website
[GitHub Pages](https://hiby90hou.github.io/tictactoe/)

## The technologies used in this project

I use Html, CSS and Javascript in this project.

## The approach taken
The webpage in this website can give user a place to play Tic-Tac-Toe.
There are 2 game models: 1 player play with AI and 2 players fighting with each other

## Installation instructions
1. git clone https://github.com/hiby90hou/tictactoe.git
2. open the index.html and then you can play

## Unsolved problems
1. The AI is not very smart
2. No online server to store the score
3. Need a function to switch game model after start the game
